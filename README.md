## Workflow

This project follows a structured workflow for generating statistical trading signals and implementing trading strategies. The key steps in the workflow are as follows:

### 1. Preprocessing Data

Before implementing trading strategies, it's essential to preprocess the data. Preprocessing involves checking for missing values (NA values), negative values, and other data quality issues. Data preprocessing ensures that the trading signals are generated using clean and reliable data.

### 2. Generating Statistical Trading Signals

The project uses various statistical trading signal strategies to make trading decisions. Each strategy generates buy and sell signals based on specific conditions. Here are the signal-generating strategies implemented in this project:

#### Moving Average Crossover Strategy

- **Golden Cross**: Buy when a short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day).
- **Death Cross**: Sell when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

#### Bollinger Bands Strategy

- Buy when the price touches or falls below the lower Bollinger Band and then moves back into the band.
- Sell when the price touches or rises above the upper Bollinger Band and then moves back into the band.

#### Relative Strength Index (RSI) Strategy

- Buy when the RSI crosses above an oversold threshold (e.g., 30), indicating a potential upward move.
- Sell when the RSI crosses below an overbought threshold (e.g., 70), indicating a potential downward move.

#### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Strategy

- Buy when the MACD line crosses above the signal line.
- Sell when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.

#### Mean Reversion Strategy

- Buy when the stock's price is significantly below its moving average, indicating it might revert to the mean.
- Sell when the stock's price is significantly above its moving average.

#### Dual Moving Average Crossover Strategy

- Use two moving averages (e.g., 10-day and 50-day). Buy when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA and sell when it crosses below.

### 3. Trading Strategies

After generating trading signals, the project implements trading strategies based on the combined signals from different strategies. The strategies aim to make buy or sell decisions, considering the signals from multiple sources. These strategies are essential for real trading decisions and can be customized to meet specific trading goals.

#### Note:

Trading strategies in this project may require further customization and validation based on the specific requirements of your trading goals and risk tolerance. Backtesting and risk management are essential components of developing effective trading strategies.

Please review and adapt the provided strategies to your needs and consider implementing additional risk management techniques and backtesting before using them in real trading.
